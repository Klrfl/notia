# Notia

Notia is born out of a programmer's insatiable need to learn a new JS framework
called Svelte. The editor is particularly bad because it's made in a day. Whatever

## Setup

This project uses pnpm, install it first:

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

run `pnpm dev` to see the app running on `localhost:5173`.
